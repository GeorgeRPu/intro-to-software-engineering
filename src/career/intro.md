# Introduction

Work is too big a thing to not take seriously. Full time employees spend 5/7 days of the week, 40+ hours, working. If you include an hour per day for commuting, around half of your waking hours are spent "working". In terms of focus, and mental energy, you will likely exert more than half at work than any other part of the day.
Your career is a big part of your life.

These hours add up. If current retirement ages hold, you will spend

40 \ \text{hours/week} \cdot 45 \ \text{weeks/year} \cdot 45 \ \text{years} \approx 80,000 \text{ hours}

working[^1]. If you go by [Malcolm Gladwell's 10,000 hour rule](https://www.newyorker.com/sports/sporting-scene/complexity-and-the-ten-thousand-hour-rule), you will spend 8x that amount of time working. Your career is long enough for you to achieve even very ambitious goals.

[^1]: Technically 81,000 hours by this estimate.
